When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    The main purpose of keeping the remote repository is to synchronize our work in the GutHub server so that we can share our work 
with others.	

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If it was done automatically then every change that we may not want to reflect in the Github 
would be reflected. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: When i fork a repository from other's account it creates a same new repo in my GitHub account having the 
same files.
    Clone: When i clone a repo it is downloaded in my local computer from the GitHub server.

    Branches: If i want to make some changes to my master branch without affecting it just for the sake of testing
 of some improvements i can make then i create a new branch that contains the same file as in master  and start
 working on it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
