What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the project root which contains all the required
metadata for the repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area holds the files before they are added to the repository from the working directory.
Being an intermediate area we can add files one by one into it and then it bundles the all files to commit to the 
repo.
